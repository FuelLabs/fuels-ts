This is a [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) project bootstrapped with [`create-fuels`](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-ts/tree/master/packages/create-fuels).

## Getting Started

1. Start the Fuel development server. This server will start a local Fuel node and provide hot-reloading for your smart contracts.

```bash
npm run fuels:dev
```

2. Start the Next.js development server.

```bash
npm run dev
```
