### Minor Changes

- `chainInfo` is now fetched and cached on all `Provider`s when they are initialized. With this release, you now need to initialize a `Provider` like so:
  ```ts
  const provider = await Provider.create(url);
  ```

- Remove `chainId` from the `Predicate` constructor. You don't need to pass in `chainId` anymore since you are passing in a `provider` already, by [@Dhaiwat10](https://github.com/Dhaiwat10) (See [#1181](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-ts/pull/1181))
