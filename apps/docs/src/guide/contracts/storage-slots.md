# Storage Slots

When deploying a contract, you can specify the custom storage slots that you want to use.

<<< @/../../../packages/fuel-gauge/src/storage-test-contract.test.ts#contract-deployment-storage-slots{ts:line-numbers}

## Using plain Javascript

In the above example, we directly imported the storage slots from a JSON file generated by the Sway compiler.

Instead of importing from a file, you can also specify the custom storage slots directly in your code:

<<< @/../../../packages/fuel-gauge/src/storage-test-contract.test.ts#contract-deployment-storage-slots-inline{ts:line-numbers}

## Auto-load of Storage Slots

Code generated using [Typegen](../abi-typegen//generating-types-from-abi.md) automatically [load](../abi-typegen/using-generated-types.md#autoloading-of-storage-slots) Storage Slots for you.
