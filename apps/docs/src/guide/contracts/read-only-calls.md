# Read-only Calls

<!-- This section should explain read-only calls -->
<!-- read:example:start -->

When interacting with a contract, you might want to call a method that does not change the state of the blockchain. For example, a method that reads a value from storage and returns it without modifying the storage.

In such cases, there's no need to create an actual blockchain transaction; you only want to read a value quickly. You can achieve this using the `.get()` method:

<!-- This section should explain why read-only calls don't require funds -->
<!-- get:example:start -->

`get()` doesn't take funding, as it is a read-only call that doesn't alter the chain state.

<!-- get:example:end -->

<!-- TODO: review dryRun sentence. Consider creating a new doc page for it as it seems to be a different subject -->

If you want to dry run a transaction call that takes funding without altering the chain state, use `dryRun()`.

## When to use `get()` vs `call()`

<!-- This section should explain when to use the get vs call methods -->
<!-- get_call:example:start -->

`get()`: Appropriate for read-only calls; use this method when calling a function that does not modify the blockchain's state. It is intended for read-only operations, like fetching data from the blockchain without making any changes. Since it doesn't require any gas or transaction fees, `get()` is a more efficient way to access data stored on the blockchain.

`call()`: Appropriate for state-changing calls; use this method when calling a function that modifies the blockchain's state, like transferring funds or updating values. Since these things involve changing the blockchain state, `call()` requires gas and transaction fees to be paid.
