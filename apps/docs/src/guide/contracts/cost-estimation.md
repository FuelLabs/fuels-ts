# Estimating contract call cost

With the function `getTransactionCost` provided by the `provider`, you can get a cost estimation for a specific call. The return type, `TransactionCost`, is an object that contains relevant information for the estimation:

<!-- TODO: stop using hardcoded snippets -->

```ts:line-numbers
type TransactionCost = {
  minGasPrice: BN;
  gasPrice: BN;
  gasUsed: BN;
  fee: BN;
};
```

Below are examples that show how to get the estimated transaction cost from single and multi call transactions.

The transaction cost estimation can be used to set the gas limit for an actual call, or to show the user the estimated cost.
