# Deploying Contracts

This guide walks you through deploying a contract using the SDK, covering loading contract artifacts, initializing a contract factory, and deploying the contract.

> **Note:** The maximum contract deployment size supported by the SDK is 100 KB. The SDK will `throw` an [error](../errors/index.md) for contracts larger than this size.

## 1. Obtaining Contract Artifacts

After writing a contract in Sway and compiling it with `forc build` (<a :href="indexUrl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">read more</a> on how to work with Sway), you will obtain two important artifacts: the compiled binary file and the JSON ABI file. These files are required for deploying a contract using the SDK.

## 2. Setting up the SDK Environment

Before deploying a contract, set up the necessary environment by importing the required SDK components and initializing a wallet and a provider.

<<< @/../../docs-snippets/src/guide/contracts/deploying-contracts.test.ts#contract-setup-1{ts:line-numbers}

## 3. Loading Contract Artifacts

Load the contract bytecode and JSON ABI, generated from the Sway source, into the SDK.

<<< @/../../docs-snippets/src/guide/contracts/deploying-contracts.test.ts#contract-setup-2{ts:line-numbers}

## 4. Deploying the Contract

To deploy the contract, instantiate the [`ContractFactory`](../../api/Contract/ContractFactory.md) with the bytecode, ABI, and wallet. Then, call the `deployContract` method. This call resolves as soon as the transaction to deploy the contract is submitted and returns three items: the `contractId`, the `transactionId` and a `waitForResult` function.

<<< @/../../docs-snippets/src/guide/contracts/deploying-contracts.test.ts#contract-setup-3{ts:line-numbers}

The `contract` instance will be returned only after calling `waitForResult` and waiting for it to resolve. To avoid blocking the rest of your code, you can attach this promise to a hook or listener that will use the contract only after it is fully deployed.

<<< @/../../docs-snippets/src/guide/contracts/deploying-contracts.test.ts#contract-setup-4{ts:line-numbers}

## 5. Executing a Contract Call

Now that the contract is deployed, you can interact with it. In the following steps, you'll learn how to execute contract calls.
