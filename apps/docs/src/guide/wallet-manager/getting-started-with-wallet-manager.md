# Getting Started with `WalletManager`

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to use `WalletManager`.

## Instantiating `WalletManager`

The `WalletManager` constructor accepts an optional object to define its storage. The storage describes how and where the `WalletManager` will store its vaults of wallets. If storage is not provided, the `WalletManager` uses a default one that does not persist data.

For now, let's keep it simple and not worry about the storage. Later we will discuss it in more detail.

To instantiate a `WalletManager` you can simply:

## Setting `WalletManager` Password

By default, a `WalletManager` instance is locked when created. Before using it, you need to unlock it by setting a password. You can do this by calling the `unlock` method.

<<< @/../../docs-snippets/src/guide/wallet-manager/getting-started-with-wallet-manager.test.ts#getting-started-with-wallet-manager-2{ts:line-numbers}

Once your `WalletManager` is unlocked, it can manage your wallets.

## Managing Vaults with `WalletManager`

A vault in `WalletManager` serves as a secure container for wallets. The `WalletManager` manages wallets by interacting with these vaults, supporting operations such as `getAccounts`, which returns public information about all wallets stored in the vault, and `exportAccount`, which exports a private key for a given wallet address.

To add a vault, we utilize the `addVault` method. Here's how we can create a private key vault and add a private key from a wallet we own:

<<< @/../../docs-snippets/src/guide/wallet-manager/getting-started-with-wallet-manager.test.ts#getting-started-with-wallet-manager-3{ts:line-numbers}

The `addVault` method requires an object with three properties: `type`, `secret`, and `title`. The `WalletManager` currently supports two types of vaults: `privateKeyVault` and `mnemonicVault`. For the `secret`, we use our wallet's private key, and for the `title`, we can provide a custom name.

By running this code, `WalletManager` creates a new vault instance of the type `privateKey` and adds one account (our wallet) to this newly created vault.

A key feature of the `WalletManager` is its ability to manage multiple vaults, even of the same type. This implies that if you run the `addVault` method again, with the same parameters, `WalletManager` will create another vault of the type `privateKey`, holding the same wallet. Here's an example:

<<< @/../../docs-snippets/src/guide/wallet-manager/getting-started-with-wallet-manager.test.ts#getting-started-with-wallet-manager-4{ts:line-numbers}

After executing this, you will find that your `WalletManager` is managing two `privateKey` vaults, both storing the same wallet.

Remember, both `title` and `secret` are optional when adding vaults, but providing a `title` makes it easier to manage your vaults and wallets. If you add a vault without providing a `secret`, this will result in one new account (wallet) being generated by the vault it self.

## Using The `WalletManager`

With your `WalletManager` set up, you can now access your vaults and wallets. Here's how to retrieve the details of your vaults:

<<< @/../../docs-snippets/src/guide/wallet-manager/getting-started-with-wallet-manager.test.ts#getting-started-with-wallet-manager-5{ts:line-numbers}

This will output something like this:

<<< @/../../docs-snippets/src/guide/wallet-manager/getting-started-with-wallet-manager.test.ts#getting-started-with-wallet-manager-6{bash:line-numbers}

As you can see, the `WalletManager` assigns unique `vaultIds` for each vault. The first vault you added has a `vaultId` of `0`, and the second one has a `vaultId` of `1`.

Let's retrieve your wallet instance with the `getWallet` method:

<<< @/../../docs-snippets/src/guide/wallet-manager/getting-started-with-wallet-manager.test.ts#getting-started-with-wallet-manager-7{ts:line-numbers}

This guide walked through the steps to instantiate a `WalletManager`, set up its first vault, and retrieve vault information. The following sections will explore more functionalities of `WalletManager`, and go deeper into the usage of its vaults and the details of its storage system.
