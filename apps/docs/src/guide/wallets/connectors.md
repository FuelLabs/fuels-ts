# Connectors

Fuel Wallet Connectors offer a standardized interface to integrate multiple wallets with your DApps, simplifying wallet integration and ensuring smooth user interactions.

## Fuel Connectors

`Fuel Connectors` are a set of standardized interfaces that provide a way to interact with various wallets and services. They offer a consistent way to interact with different wallets and services, allowing developers to focus on building their applications rather than worrying about wallet integration.

To build your own wallet integration, you can create a custom connector that extends the abstract [`FuelConnector`](../../api/Account/FuelConnector.md) class. This interface provides a set of methods and events that allow you to interact with the wallet and handle various operations such as connecting, disconnecting, signing messages, and sending transactions.

### Properties

The `FuelConnector` abstract class provides several properties that should be implemented to provide information about the connector.

#### `name`

The `name` property is simply a `string` on the connector that serves as an identifier and will be displayed to the end-user when selecting a connector.

<<< @/../../docs-snippets/src/guide/wallets/connectors.test.ts#fuel-connector-name{ts:line-numbers}

#### `metadata`

The `metadata` property on the connector provides additional information about the connector. This information will be displayed to the end-user when selecting a connector. The following is the structure of the `metadata` object:

<<< @/../../../packages/account/src/connectors/types/connector-metadata.ts#fuel-connector-metadata{ts:line-numbers}

##### `install`

The `metadata.install` property (_required_) is used to provide information about how to install the connector.

The `install` object requires three properties:

- `action` (_required_) - a `string` that will contain an action string that will be displayed to the user (e.g. "Install").

- `link` (_required_) - a `string` that will contain a URL that will be opened when the user clicks the action.

- `description` (_required_) - a `string` that will contain a description of the installation process.

<<< @/../../docs-snippets/src/guide/wallets/connectors.test.ts#fuel-connector-metadata-install{ts:line-numbers}

##### `image`

The `metadata.image` property (_optional_) provides an image that will be displayed to the end-user when selecting a connector. The image will be a URL to the image to be displayed (this can be an inline data URI, encoded in base64).

<<< @/../../docs-snippets/src/guide/wallets/connectors.test.ts#fuel-connector-metadata-image{ts:line-numbers}

You can even define a `light` and `dark` theme for the image by providing an object with the `light` and `dark` keys (these will take a similar URI as above).

<<< @/../../docs-snippets/src/guide/wallets/connectors.test.ts#fuel-connector-metadata-image-theme{ts:line-numbers}

### Events

The `FuelConnector` class provides a number of events that enable developers to listen for changes in the connector state. As part of implementing a custom connector, you can emit these events to notify the consumer dApp of changes.

#### `accounts`

The `accounts` event is emitted every time a connector's accounts change. The event data is an array of `string` addresses available on the network.

<<< @/../../docs-snippets/src/guide/wallets/connectors.test.ts#fuel-connector-events-accounts{ts:line-numbers}

#### `connectors`

The `connectors` event is emitted when the connectors are initialized. The event data is an array of [`FuelConnector`](../../api/Account/FuelConnector.md) objects available on the network.

<<< @/../../docs-snippets/src/guide/wallets/connectors.test.ts#fuel-connector-events-connectors{ts:line-numbers}

#### `currentConnector`

The `currentConnector` event is emitted every time the current connector changes. The event data is a [`FuelConnector`](../../api/Account/FuelConnector.md) object that is currently connected.

<<< @/../../docs-snippets/src/guide/wallets/connectors.test.ts#fuel-connector-events-currentConnector{ts:line-numbers}

#### `currentAccount`

## Connectors Manager

The TS SDK exports the `Fuel` class, which serves as the connectors manager. This class provides the interface for interacting with the TS SDK and the broader Fuel ecosystem.

It can be instantiated as follows:

<<< @/../../docs-snippets/src/guide/wallets/connectors.test.ts#fuel-instantiation-1{ts:line-numbers}

> [!NOTE] Note
> We recommend initializing the Fuel class with the `init` method to avoid any potential race conditions that may arise from the async nature of instantiating a connector.

### Options

Several options can be passed to the `Fuel` connector manager:

- [`connectors`](#connectors)
- [`storage`](#storage)
- [`targetObject`](#targetobject)

#### `connectors`

The `connectors` option provides a list of connectors with which the `Fuel` connector manager can interact. The manager interacts with the connectors, which in turn handle communication with the respective wallet. You can find a list of all the connectors in our [`FuelLabs/fuel-connectors`](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-connectors).

Below, we initialize the manager using the `defaultConnectors` method which provides an array of all the default connectors available in the `fuel-connectors` package. Supplying the `devMode` flag as `true` will enable the development wallet for the connectors (to install visit our [wallet documentation](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/wallet/install/)).

<<< @/../../docs-snippets/src/guide/wallets/connectors.test.ts#fuel-options-connectors{ts:line-numbers}

#### `storage`

The `storage` is used internally to store the current connector state. It can be overridden by passing an instance that extends the `StorageAbstract` class.

<<< @/../../docs-snippets/src/guide/wallets/connectors.test.ts#fuel-options-storage-memory{ts:line-numbers}

The default behavior will use `LocalStorage` if the `window` is available:

<<< @/../../docs-snippets/src/guide/wallets/connectors.test.ts#fuel-options-storage-local{ts:line-numbers}

#### `targetObject`

The `targetObject` provides a target with which the `Fuel` manager can interact. Used for registering events and can be overridden as follows:

<<< @/../../docs-snippets/src/guide/wallets/connectors.test.ts#fuel-options-target-object{ts:line-numbers}

### Methods

The `Fuel` manager provides several methods to interact with the Manager:

#### All methods from connectors

The `Fuel` manager provides all the [methods](#methods) available from the connected connectors. Thus, you can interact with the current connector as if you were interacting with the `Fuel` manager directly.

If no current connector is available or connected, it will throw an error.

#### `connectors`

The `connectors` method gets the current list of _installed_ and _connected_ connectors.

<<< @/../../../packages/account/src/connectors/fuel.ts#connector-manager-method-connectors{ts:line-numbers}

#### `getConnector`

The `getConnector` method resolves a connector by its name. This is useful for finding a specific connector with which to interact. If the connector is not found, it will return `null`.

<<< @/../../../packages/account/src/connectors/fuel.ts#connector-manager-method-getConnector{ts:line-numbers}

#### `hasConnector`

The `hasConnector` method will return `true` under the following conditions:

- There is a current connector that is connected.
- A connector is connected within two seconds of calling the method.

<<< @/../../../packages/account/src/connectors/fuel.ts#connector-manager-method-hasConnector{ts:line-numbers}

#### `selectConnector`

The `selectConnector` method accepts a connector name and will return `true` when it is _available_ and _connected_. Otherwise, if not found or unavailable, it will return `false`.

<<< @/../../../packages/account/src/connectors/fuel.ts#connector-manager-method-selectConnector{ts:line-numbers}

#### `currentConnector`

The `currentConnector` method will return the current connector that is connected or if one is available and connected, otherwise it'll return `null` or `undefined`.

<<< @/../../../packages/account/src/connectors/fuel.ts#connector-manager-method-currentConnector{ts:line-numbers}

#### `getWallet`

The `getWallet` method accepts an address (string or instance) as the first parameter and a provider or network as the second parameter. It will return an `Account` instance for the given address (providing it is valid).

The provider or network will default to the current network if not provided. When a provider cannot be resolved, it will throw an [`INVALID_PROVIDER`](../errors/index.md) error.

<<< @/../../../packages/account/src/connectors/fuel.ts#connector-manager-method-getWallet{ts:line-numbers}

#### `clean`

The `clean` method removes all the data currently stored in the [`storage`](#storage) instance.

<<< @/../../../packages/account/src/connectors/fuel.ts#connector-manager-method-clean{ts:line-numbers}

#### `unsubscribe`

The `unsubscribe` method removes all currently registered event listeners.

<<< @/../../../packages/account/src/connectors/fuel.ts#connector-manager-method-unsubscribe{ts:line-numbers}

#### `destroy`

The `destroy` method unsubscribes from all the event listeners and clears the storage.

<<< @/../../../packages/account/src/connectors/fuel.ts#connector-manager-method-destroy{ts:line-numbers}
