# Asset Transfers

This documentation provides a guide on how to transfer assets between wallets and to contracts using the SDK.

## Transferring Assets Between Wallets

The `wallet.transfer` function is used to initiate a transaction that transfers an asset from one wallet to another. This function requires three parameters:

1. The receiver's wallet address.
2. The amount of the asset to be transferred.
3. The ID of the asset to be transferred.

Upon execution, this function returns a promise that resolves to a transaction response. To wait for the transaction to be mined, call `response.wait()`.

### Example

Here is an illustration on how to use the `wallet.transfer` function:

## Transferring Assets To Contracts

When transferring assets to a deployed contract, we use the `transferToContract` method. This method closely mirrors the `wallet.transfer` method in terms of parameter structure.

However, instead of supplying the target wallet's address, as done in `myWallet.address` for the transfer method, we need to provide an instance of [Address](../types/address.md) created from the deployed contract id.

If you have the [Contract](../contracts/) instance of the deployed contract, you can simply use its `id` property. However, if the contract was deployed with `forc deploy` or not by you, you will likely only have its ID in a hex string format. In such cases, you can create an [Address](../types/address.md) instance from the contract ID using `Address.fromAddressOrString('0x123...')`.

### Example

Here's an example demonstrating how to use `transferToContract`:

<<< @/../../docs-snippets/src/guide/wallets/transferring-assets.test.ts#transferring-assets-2{ts:line-numbers}

Remember to always invoke the `waitForResult()` function on the transaction response. This ensures that the transaction has been successfully mined before proceeding.
