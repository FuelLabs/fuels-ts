# Wallet Transferring

This guide demonstrates how to transfer assets between accounts and contracts, and how to validate your balance prior to a transfer.

## Transferring Between Wallets

Transferring assets between wallets is really simple within the SDK.

After waiting the transaction to be processed, the assets are successfully moved to the recipient's wallet.

It is also possible to specify the recipient's address as a string:

<<< @/../../docs-snippets/src/guide/wallets/wallet-transferring.test.ts#wallet-transferring-2{ts:line-numbers}

When transferring the base chain coin like ETH, you can omit the `assetId`:

## Transferring To Contracts

Transferring assets from your wallet to a deployed contract is straightforward. All you need is the contract's address.

You can transfer assets to a deployed contract instance by using its `id`:

<<< @/../../docs-snippets/src/guide/wallets/wallet-transferring.test.ts#wallet-transferring-4{ts:line-numbers}

Alternatively, you can simply use the contract's string address in the [`Bech32`](../types/bech32) format:

<<< @/../../docs-snippets/src/guide/wallets/wallet-transferring.test.ts#wallet-transferring-5{ts:line-numbers}

# Balances

Before transferring assets, ensure your wallet has sufficient funds. Attempting a transfer without enough funds will result in an error: `not enough coins to fit the target`.

You can see how to check your balance at the [`checking-balances`](./checking-balances) page.
