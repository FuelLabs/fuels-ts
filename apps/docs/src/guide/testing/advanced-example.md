A more complex example showcasing genesis block state configuration with [`walletsConfig`](./test-node-options.md#walletsconfig) and deployment of multiple contracts is shown below.

<<< @/../../docs-snippets2/src/testing/launching-a-test-node.ts#advanced-example{ts:line-numbers}

## Summary

1. All points listed in the [basic example](./basic-example.md#summary) apply here as well.
1. Multiple wallets were generated with highly-specific coins and messages.
1. It's possible to specify the wallet to be used for contract deployment via `walletIndex`.
1. The test contract can be deployed with all the options available for real contract deployment.
