# Send And Spend Funds From Predicates

Predicates can be used to validate transactions. This implies that a predicate can safeguard assets, only allowing their transfer if the predicate conditions are met.

This guide will demonstrate how to send and spend funds using a predicate.

## Predicate Example

Consider the following predicate:

<<< @/../../docs-snippets/test/fixtures/forc-projects/simple-predicate/src/main.sw#send-and-spend-funds-from-predicates-1{rust:line-numbers}

This predicate accepts an address of type `b256` and compares it with a hardcoded address of the same type. If both addresses are equal, the predicate returns true, otherwise it will return false.

## Interacting with the Predicate Using SDK

Let's use the above predicate to validate our transaction.

Once you've compiled the predicate (`forc build`), you'll obtain two important artifacts: the JSON ABI and the predicate's binary code. These are needed to instantiate a new predicate.

<<< @/../../docs-snippets/src/guide/predicates/send-and-spend-funds-from-predicates.test.ts#send-and-spend-funds-from-predicates-2{ts:line-numbers}

With the predicate instantiated, we can transfer funds to its address. This requires us to have a wallet with sufficient funds. If you're unsure about using wallets with the SDK, we recommend checking out our [wallet](../wallets/access.md) guide.

<<< @/../../docs-snippets/src/guide/predicates/send-and-spend-funds-from-predicates.test.ts#send-and-spend-funds-from-predicates-3{ts:line-numbers}

Now that our predicate holds funds, we can use it to validate a transaction.

First, we need to set its data. Note that the `main` function in our predicate example requires a parameter called `input_address` of type `b256`. We achieve this using the `Predicate` class method `setData`.

<<< @/../../docs-snippets/src/guide/predicates/send-and-spend-funds-from-predicates.test.ts#send-and-spend-funds-from-predicates-4{ts:line-numbers}

We are now ready to use our predicate to execute our transfer. We can achieve that by doing the following:

<<< @/../../docs-snippets/src/guide/predicates/send-and-spend-funds-from-predicates.test.ts#send-and-spend-funds-from-predicates-5{ts:line-numbers}

Note the method transfer has two parameters: the recipient's address and the intended transfer amount.

Once the predicate resolves with a return value `true` based on its predefined condition, our predicate successfully spends its funds by means of a transfer to a desired wallet.

## Spending Entire Predicate Held Amount

Trying to forward the entire amount held by the predicate results in an error because no funds are left to cover the transaction fees. Attempting this will result in an error message like:

<<< @/../../docs-snippets/src/guide/predicates/send-and-spend-funds-from-predicates.test.ts#send-and-spend-funds-from-predicates-6{ts:line-numbers}

## Predicate Validation Failure

What happens when a predicate fails to validate? Recall our predicate only validates if the `input_address` matches the hardcoded `valid_address`. Hence, if we set a different data from the `valid_address`, the predicate will fail to validate.

When a predicate fails to validate, the SDK throws an error that starts like this:

<<< @/../../docs-snippets/src/guide/predicates/send-and-spend-funds-from-predicates.test.ts#send-and-spend-funds-from-predicates-7{ts:line-numbers}
