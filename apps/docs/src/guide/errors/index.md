# Errors

All errors thrown from our SDK are instances of the `FuelError` class, which will have an accompanying `ErrorCode`. Below you will find a table with all our expected error codes and their descriptions.

## Error Codes

Here are a list of the expected error code's that can be thrown by the SDK. These error codes are used to help you debug and understand the error that has been thrown.ÃŸ
