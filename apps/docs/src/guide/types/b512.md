# B512

In Sway, the `B512` type is commonly used to handle public keys and signatures. This guide will explain how the `B512` type is defined in Sway, how to visualize a `B512` value using the SDK, and how to interact with a contract function that accepts a `B512` parameter.

The `B512` type in Sway is a wrapper around two `B256` types, allowing for the representation of 64-byte values. It is defined as a struct:

<<< @/../../docs/sway/bytecode-input/src/main.sw#b512-1{rs:line-numbers}

## `B512` in the SDK

In the SDK, you can visualize a `B512` value by examining a wallet's public key:

<<< @./snippets/b512/b512-in-the-sdk.ts#snippet-1{ts:line-numbers}

## Example: Echoing a `B512` Value in a Contract Function

Let's consider a contract function that accepts a `B512` parameter and returns the same value:

<<< @/../../docs/sway/echo-values/src/main.sw#b512-3{rust:line-numbers}

To call this function and validate the returned value, follow these steps:

<<< @./snippets/b512/echoing-a-b512.ts#snippet-1{ts:line-numbers}

In this example, we generate a wallet, use its public key as the `B512` input, call the `echo_b512` contract function, and expect the returned value to match the original input.
