# Getting Started with Fuels-ts

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and using the Fuels-ts library in your front-end project.

## Installing the Fuels-ts Library

To begin, you need to add the `fuels` dependency to your project. You can do this using the following command:

::: code-group

```sh [npm]
npm install fuels --save
```

```sh [pnpm]
pnpm add fuels
```

:::

### Note

If you are using bun, you'll need to add a `trustedDependencies` field to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  ...,
  "trustedDependencies": [
    "@fuel-ts/fuel-core",
    "@fuel-ts/forc"
  ]
}
```

This is to ensure that bun includes the `fuel-core` and `forc` binaries in your project.

## Creating a React Component to Connect to the Blockchain

With the Fuels dependency set up, you can now create a React component that will connect to the Fuel provider and retrieve the base asset balance for a given wallet address. Here's an example of how to do this:

<!-- TODO: Create properly code snippet on new package: `app/react-app` after https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-ts/pull/827 got merged -->

```tsx
import { BN, Provider, Wallet } from "fuels";
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

function App() {
  const [balance, setBalance] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    async () => {
      const provider = await Provider.create("https://beta-4.fuel.network/graphql");
      const myWallet = Wallet.fromAddress("0x...", provider);
      myWallet.getBalances().then((data) => {
        setBalance(new BN(data[0].amount).toNumber());
      });
    }()
  }, []);

  return <div>My Balance: {balance}</div>;
}

export default App;
```
