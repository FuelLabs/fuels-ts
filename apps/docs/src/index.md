## Import

<!-- TODO: stop using hard-coded snippets -->

```ts:line-numbers
import { Wallet } from "fuels";

// Random Wallet
console.log(Wallet.generate());

// Using privateKey Wallet
console.log(Wallet.fromPrivateKey(PRIVATE_KEY));
```

## Calling Contracts

<!-- TODO: stop using hard-coded snippets -->

```ts:line-numbers
import { Provider, Wallet, Contract, BigNumberish, BN } from "fuels";
import abi from "./abi.json";

const provider = await Provider.create('https://beta-5.fuel.network/graphql');
const wallet = Wallet.fromPrivateKey(PRIVATE_KEY, provider); // private key with coins
const contractId = "0x...";
const contract = new Contract(contractId, abi, wallet);

// All contract methods are available under functions
const { transactionId, value } = await contract.functions
  .foo<[BigNumberish], BN>("bar")
  .call();

console.log(transactionId, value);
```

## Deploying Contracts

<!-- TODO: stop using hard-coded snippets -->

```ts:line-numbers
import { Provider, ContractFactory } from "fuels";
// Byte code generated using: forc build
import bytecode from "./bytecode.bin";

const factory = new ContractFactory(bytecode, [], wallet);
const contract = await factory.deployContract();

console.log(contract.id);
```
