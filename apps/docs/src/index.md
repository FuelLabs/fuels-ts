// Random Wallet
console.log(Wallet.generate());

// Using privateKey Wallet
console.log(new Wallet("0x0000...0000"));
```

## Calling Contracts

```ts:line-numbers
import { Wallet, Contract, BigNumberish, BN } from "fuels";
import abi from "./abi.json";

const wallet = new Wallet("0x..."); // private key with coins
const contractId = "0x...";
const contract = new Contract(contractId, abi, wallet);

// All contract methods are available under functions
const { transactionId, value } = await contract.functions
  .foo<[BigNumberish], BN>("bar")
  .call();

console.log(transactionId, value);
```

const factory = new ContractFactory(bytecode, [], wallet);
const contract = await factory.deployContract(factory);

console.log(contract.id);
```
