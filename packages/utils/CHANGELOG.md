  - `getForcProject` now supports both `debug` and `release` builds, by [@nedsalk](https://github.com/nedsalk) (See [#1744](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-ts/pull/1744))

## 0.73.0

## 0.72.0

### Minor Changes

- chore!: share single chainconfig and `launchNode` utility throughout the codebase.
  - `startFuelCore` now re-uses `launchNode` instead of having its own node-launching logic
  - `@fuel-ts/utils` now exports a `defaultChainConfig` and a `defaultConsensusKey` which is used everywhere in the source code.
  - The `chainConfig.json` file inside the `.fuel-core` folder at the root also uses the same chain config. The `run-node` script has been modified to copy over the contents of the chain config file from the utils package.
  # Breaking Changes
  - Multiple fuel-core config-related options have been removed from `LaunchNodeOptions`:
  - `chainConfigPath`
  - `consensusKey`
  - `useInMemoryDb`
  - `poaInstant`
  - The only way to pass in these config values now is through the `args` property, i.e.:
  ````ts
  const { cleanup, ip, port } = await launchNode({
  args: ["--poa-interval-period", "750ms", "--poa-instant", "false"],
  });
  ```, by [@arboleya](https://github.com/arboleya) (See [#1495](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-ts/pull/1495))
