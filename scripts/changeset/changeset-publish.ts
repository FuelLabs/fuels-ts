   * Tagging MUST be done after the branch is published so that the GitHub release is tied to the proper commit.
   * If this isn't done then the changesets workflow will always create a tag and release based off of the latest commit on the default branch (master).
   * That is okay if we're publishing master, but not okay if we're publishing a release/* branch.
   * In the case of patching old releases via release/* branches,
   * that would lead to mismatch between the actual published commit and the one referenced in the GitHub release.
   *
   * This is where the tagging would happen if we didn't tag it ourselves:
