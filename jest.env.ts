/**
 * Gets the private key for the current Jest worker.
 *
 * The PK is basically the current worker's ID. This allows us to
 * have a unique faucet wallet for each file being tested and prevents
 * tests from trying to access to the same coins and fail.
 *
 * Both `faucets.json` and `initial_state.coins` in `chainConfig.json`
 * were manually generated to support at most 16 workers.
 *
 * For each wallet in `faucets.json`, there are three coins for each
 * of the following Asset IDs:
 *   - 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
 *   - 0x0101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101
 *   - 0x0202020202020202020202020202020202020202020202020202020202020202
