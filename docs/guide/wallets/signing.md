# Signing

Once you've instantiated your wallet in an unlocked state using one of the previously discussed methods, you can sign a message with `wallet.sign_message`. Below is a full example of how to sign and recover a message.


```typescript
  import { WalletUnlocked, hashMessage, Signer} from 'fuels';
  const wallet = WalletUnlocked.generate();
  const message = 'doc-test-message';
  const signedMessage = await wallet.signMessage(message);
  const hashedMessage = hashMessage(message);
  const recoveredAddress = Signer.recoverAddress(hashedMessage, signedMessage);

  expect(wallet.privateKey).toBeTruthy();
  expect(wallet.publicKey).toBeTruthy();
  expect(wallet.address).toEqual(recoveredAddress);
```

You can also sign a _transaction_ by using `wallet.sign_transaction`. Below is a full example of how to sign and recover a transaction.


```typescript
    import { WalletUnlocked, hashMessage, Signer} from 'fuels';
    const wallet = new WalletUnlocked(signTransactionTest.privateKey);
    const transactionRequest = signTransactionTest.transaction;
    const signedTransaction = await wallet.signTransaction(transactionRequest);
    const verifiedAddress = Signer.recoverAddress(
      hashTransaction(transactionRequest),
      signedTransaction
    );

    expect(signedTransaction).toEqual(signTransactionTest.signedTransaction);
    expect(verifiedAddress).toEqual(wallet.address);
```
