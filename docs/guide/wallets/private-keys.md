# Creating a wallet from a private key

A new wallet with a randomly generated private key can be created by supplying `Wallet.generate`.


```typescript
  import { Wallet, WalletLocked, WalletUnlocked } from 'fuels';

  // use the `generate` helper to make an Unlocked Wallet
  const myWallet: WalletUnlocked = Wallet.generate();

  // or use an Address to create a wallet
  const someWallet: WalletLocked = Wallet.fromAddress(myWallet.address);
```

Alternatively, you can create a wallet from a Private Key:


```typescript
  // unlock an existing wallet
  let unlockedWallet: WalletUnlocked = lockedWallet.unlock(PRIVATE_KEY);
  // or directly from a private key
  unlockedWallet = Wallet.fromPrivateKey(PRIVATE_KEY);
```

You can obtain an address to a private key using the `Signer` package

```typescript
  const signer = new Signer(PRIVATE_KEY);
  // validate address
  expect(wallet.address).toEqual(signer.address);
```
