# Transferring assets

With `wallet.transfer` you can initiate a transaction to transfer an asset from your wallet to a target address.


```rust
    // setup a provider and two test wallets
    const provider = new Provider('http://127.0.0.1:4000/graphql');
    const sender = await generateTestWallet(provider, [[100, NativeAssetId]]);
    const receiver = await generateTestWallet(provider);

    // transfer 1 unit of the base asset
    const response = await sender.transfer(receiver.address, 1, NativeAssetId);
    await response.wait();

    // retrieve balances of both wallets
    const senderBalances = await sender.getBalances();
    const receiverBalances = await receiver.getBalances();
    // validate new balances
    expect(senderBalances).toEqual([{ assetId: NativeAssetId, amount: bn(99) }]);
    expect(receiverBalances).toEqual([{ assetId: NativeAssetId, amount: bn(1) }]);
```
