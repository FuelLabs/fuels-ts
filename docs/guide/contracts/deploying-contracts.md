# Deploying contracts

There are two main ways of working with contracts in the SDK: deploying a contract with SDK or using the SDK to interact with existing contracts.

## Deploying a contract binary

Once you've written a contract in Sway and compiled it with `forc build` (read [here](https://fuellabs.github.io/sway/master/introduction/overview.html) for more on how to work with Sway), you'll have in your hands two important artifacts: the compiled binary file and the JSON ABI file.

Below is how you can deploy your contracts using the SDK. For more details about each component in this process, read about [the FuelVM binary file](./the-fuelvm-binary-file.md) and [the JSON ABI file](./the-json-abi-file.md).

### The deploy functions

If you are only interested in a single instance of your contract, then use `deploy`


```typescript
    import { Provider, TestUtils, ContractFactory } from 'fuels';
    // basic setup
    const provider = new Provider('http://127.0.0.1:4000/graphql');
    const wallet = await TestUtils.generateTestWallet(provider, [[5_000_000, NativeAssetId]]);

    // load the byteCode of the contract, generated from Sway source
    const byteCode = readFileSync(
      join(__dirname, '../test-projects/storage-test-contract/out/debug/storage-test.bin')
    );

    // load the JSON abi of the contract, generated from Sway source
    const abi = JSON.parse(
      readFileSync(
        join(__dirname, '../test-projects/storage-test-contract/out/debug/storage-test-abi.json')
      ).toString()
    );

    // send byteCode and ABI to ContractFactory to load
    const factory = new ContractFactory(byteCode, abi, wallet);
```

You can then use the contract methods very simply:

```typescript
const contact = await factory.deployContract();
```

Also read about how to [generate-contract-types-from-abi](./generate-contract-types-from-abi.md), allowing for rich TypeScript backed Fuel usage.
