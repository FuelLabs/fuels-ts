# Multiple contract calls

At a basic level, you can call the same contract function multiple times in the same transaction:

```typescript
    const contract = await setupContract();

    const { value: results } = await contract
      .multiCall([contract.functions.foo(1336), contract.functions.foo(1336)])
      .call();
    expect(JSON.stringify(results)).toEqual(JSON.stringify([bn(1337), bn(1337)]));
```

## Different contracts in multicalls

You can execute multiple contract calls to distinct contracts within a single transaction. To achieve this, you first prepare all the contract calls that you want to bundle:


```typescript
    const contract = await setupContract();
    const otherContract = await setupContract({
      cache: false,
    });
    const calls = [
      contract.functions.foo(1336),
      contract.functions.call_external_foo(1336, otherContract.id),
    ];
```

---


You can also set call parameters, variable outputs, or external contracts for every contract call, as long as you don't execute it with `call()` or `simulate()`. See also [call parameters](./call-parameters.md).

Next, you provide the prepared calls to the `multiCall` method and optionally configure transaction parameters:


```typescript
    const scope = contract.multiCall(calls).addContracts([otherContract.id]);
```

---


> **Note:** any transaction parameters configured on separate contract calls are disregarded in favor of the parameters provided to `multiCall`.

## Output values

To get the output values of the bundled calls, invoke of `call()` or `simulate()`:


```typescript
    const { value: results } = await scope.call();
    expect(JSON.stringify(results)).toEqual(JSON.stringify([bn(1337), bn(1338)]));
```
