# Variable outputs

In some cases, you might want to send funds to the output of a transaction. Sway has a specific method for that: `transfer_to_address(coins, asset_id, recipient)`. So, if you have a contract that does something like this:

```rust
    fn transfer_coins_to_output(coins: u64, asset_id: ContractId, recipient: Address) {
        transfer_to_address(coins, asset_id, recipient);
    }
```

With the SDK, you can call `transfer_coins_to_output` by chaining `append_variable_outputs(amount)` to your contract call. Like this:


```typescript
    await token.functions
      .transfer_coins_to_output(50, tokenId, addressId)
      .txParams({
        variableOutputs: 1,
      })
      .call();
```

In the TS-SDK, the Output variables are automatically added to the transaction's list of outputs. The output's amount and the owner may vary based on transaction execution.

Note that the Sway `lib-std` function `mint_to_address` calls `transfer_to_address` under the hood.
