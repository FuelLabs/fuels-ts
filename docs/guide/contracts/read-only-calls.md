# Read-only calls

Sometimes you want to call a contract method that does not change the state of the blockchain. For instance, a method that only _reads_ a value from storage and returns it without making any changes to storage.

In this case, there is no need to create an actual blockchain transaction; you only want to read a value quickly.

You can do this with the SDK. Instead of `.call()`ing the method, use `.get()`:


```typescript
    const contract = await setupContract();
    const { value } = await contract.functions.echo_b256(contract.id.toB256()).get();
    expect(value).toEqual(contract.id.toB256());
```

Note that `get()` uses a method called `dryRun()` under the hood, and does not fund the transaction with any coins. If you want to test a read-only call and fund it with coins, use `dryRun()` directly.

## When to use `get()` vs `call()`

Anytime you want to call a method that does _not_ change the state of the blockchain, use `get()`. If you want to call a method that _does_ change the state of the blockchain, use `call()`.

`get()` is intended to be used only for read-only calls.
