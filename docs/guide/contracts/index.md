# Calling contracts

Once you've deployed your contract, as seen in the previous sections, you'll likely want to:

1. Call contract methods;
2. Configure call and transaction parameters such as gas price, byte price, and gas limit;
3. Forward coins and gas in your contract calls;
4. Read and interpret returned values and logs.

Here's an example. Suppose your Sway contract has two ABI methods called `echo_str_8(str[8])` and `echo_u8(u8)`. Once you've deployed the contract, you can call the methods like this:


```typescript
    const { value } = await contractInstance.functions.echo_str_8('fuel-sdk').call();

    expect(value).toBe('fuel-sdk');
```

```typescript
    const { value } = await contractInstance.functions.echo_u8(3).call();
    expect(value).toBe(3);
```

The examples above uses all the default configurations and performs a simple contract call.

Next, we'll see how we can further configure the many different parameters in a contract call
