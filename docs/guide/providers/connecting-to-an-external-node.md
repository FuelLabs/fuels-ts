# Connecting to the Testnet or an external node

We can interact with the `Testnet` node by using the following example.


```typescript
  import { Provider, WalletUnlocked } from 'fuels';
  const provider = new Provider('node-beta-2.fuel.network');
  // Setup a private key
  const PRIVATE_KEY = 'a1447cd75accc6b71a976fd3401a1f6ce318d27ba660b0315ee6ac347bf39568';

  // Create the wallet, passing provider
  const wallet: WalletUnlocked = Wallet.fromPrivateKey(PRIVATE_KEY, provider);

  const signer = new Signer(PRIVATE_KEY);
  // validate address
  expect(wallet.address).toEqual(signer.address);
```

In the code example, we connected a new provider to the Testnet node and created a new wallet from a private key.

> **Note:** New wallets on the Testnet will not have any assets! They can be obtained by providing the wallet address to the faucet at
>
> [faucet-beta-1.fuel.network](https://faucet-beta-1.fuel.network)
>
> Once the assets have been transferred to the wallet, you can reuse it in other tests by providing the private key!
>
> In addition to the faucet, there is a block explorer for the Tesnet at
>
> [block-explorer](https://fuellabs.github.io/block-explorer-v2)

If you want to connect to another node just change the url or IP and port. For example, to connect to a local node that was created with `fuel-core` you can use:


```typescript
  import { Provider, WalletUnlocked } from 'fuels';
  const localProvider = new Provider('http://127.0.0.1:4000/graphql');
  // Setup a private key
  const PRIVATE_KEY = 'a1447cd75accc6b71a976fd3401a1f6ce318d27ba660b0315ee6ac347bf39568';

  // Create the wallet, passing provider
  const wallet: WalletUnlocked = Wallet.fromPrivateKey(PRIVATE_KEY, localProvider);

  const signer = new Signer(PRIVATE_KEY);
  // validate address
  expect(wallet.address).toEqual(signer.address);
```
