# Calling a script

Suppose your Sway script `main` function is written using the arguments passed to the `main` function like so:


```rust
script;

use std::logging::log;

fn main(foo: u8) -> u8 {
    log("u8 foo");
    log(foo);
    foo
}
```

You can still hand code out a solution wrapper using `callScript` utility to call your script with data. However, if you prefer to use the ABI generated from your script, you can use the `ScriptFactory` helper:


```typescript
    const foo = 33;
    const scriptInstance = new Script<BigNumberish[], BigNumberish>(scriptBin, scriptAbi, wallet);

    const { value, logs } = await scriptInstance.functions.main(foo).call();
```
