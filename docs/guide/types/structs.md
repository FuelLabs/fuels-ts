# Structs

A `struct` in Sway is equivalent to an `Object` in TypeScript, where the property names and types must match what is defined in Sway.

Here is an example of the `struct` in Sway:

```rust
pub struct ComplexStruct {
    foo: u8,
    bar: u64,
    baz: str[9],
}
```
###### [see code in context](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-ts/blob/master/packages/fuel-gauge/test-projects/coverage-contract/src/main.sw#L30-L36)

And the same structure represented in TypeScript:

```typescript
type ComplexStruct {
    foo: u8,
    bar: u64,
    baz: str[9],
}

let myStruct: ComplexStruct = {
  foo: 1,
  bar: 11337n,
  baz: "123456789",
};
```
