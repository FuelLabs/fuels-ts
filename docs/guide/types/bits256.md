# Bits256

In Fuel, a type called `b256` represents hashes and holds a 256-bit value. The TypeScript SDK represents `b256` as `string` value for portability and can convert to `Uint8Array` as needed when the [raw bytes](./bytes32.md) are required.

Here are some example tools in the SDK:

A Bit256 value is also supported as part of the [Address](./address.md) libraries.
