# Address

`Address` is a wrapper on `Bytes32` and `Bech32` (see [Address documentation](../../packages/fuel-ts-address/)). The available interface of the TS-SDK Address contains many useful functions to switch between Address formats:


```typescript
export abstract class AbstractAddress {
  abstract toJSON(): string;
  abstract toString(): string;
  abstract toAddress(): Bech32Address;
  abstract toB256(): B256Address;
  abstract toHexString(): string;
  abstract toBytes(): Uint8Array;
  abstract equals(other: AbstractAddress): boolean;
}
```

These are the main ways of creating an `Address`

From a [Bech32](./bech32.md) Address:


```typescript
  import { Address } from 'fuels';

  const address = new Address(ADDRESS_BECH32);

  expect(address.toB256()).toEqual(ADDRESS_B256);
  expect(address.toBytes()).toEqual(ADDRESS_BYTES);
  // Hex string values are equivalent to B256
  expect(address.toHexString()).toEqual(ADDRESS_B256);
```

From a Public Key:


```typescript
  const address = Address.fromPublicKey(PUBLIC_KEY);

  expect(address.toAddress()).toEqual(ADDRESS_BECH32);
  expect(address.toB256()).toEqual(ADDRESS_B256);
```

From a [256 Bit Address](./bits256.md) Address:


```typescript
  import { Address } from 'fuels';
  const address = Address.fromB256(ADDRESS_B256);

  expect(address.toAddress()).toEqual(ADDRESS_BECH32);
  expect(address.toB256()).toEqual(ADDRESS_B256);
```

You can also use a number of utilities as part of the Address Class:


```typescript
  // you can make a random address - useful for testing
  const address = Address.fromRandom();

  // you can it has a new Address from an ambiguous source that may be a Bech32 or B256 address
  const addressCloneFromBech = Address.fromString(address.toString());
  const addressCloneFromB256 = Address.fromString(address.toB256());

  // if you aren't sure where the address comes from, use fromDynamicInput
  const dataFromInput: string =
    '0xf1e92c42b90934aa6372e30bc568a326f6e66a1a0288595e6e3fbd392a4f3e6e';
  // if the input string can't be resolved this will throw an error
  const someAddress = Address.fromDynamicInput(dataFromInput);

  // you can verify equality using the helper functions
  expect(address.equals(addressCloneFromBech)).toBeTruthy();
  expect(addressCloneFromBech.toString()).toEqual(addressCloneFromB256.toString());
  expect(someAddress).toBeTruthy();
```
