# Vectors

## Passing in vectors

You can pass a JavaScript `Array` into your contract method transparently, allowing passthrough of expected data via the type regardless of Array type.

A basic Vector is just a Typed Array:

```typescript
// aka Vec<u8>
let basicNumberVector = [1, 2, 3];
```

Here is an example of a sample `struct` in Sway:

```rust
pub struct ComplexStruct {
    foo: u8,
    bar: u64,
    baz: str[9],
}
```

---


And the contract method using this `struct` in a `Vector`:

```rust
    fn echo_struct_vector_last(vector: Vec<ComplexStruct>) -> ComplexStruct {
        vector.get(vector.len() - 1).unwrap()
    }
```

The following code calls this Sway contract method which accepts a `Vec<ComplexStruct>`.

```typescript
        [
          {
            foo: 1,
            bar: 11337n,
            baz: '123456789',
          },
          {
            foo: 2,
            bar: 21337n,
            baz: 'alphabet!',
          },
          last,
        ]
```

You can use a vector just like you would use any other type -- e.g. a `[Vec<u32>; 2]` or a `SomeStruct<Vec<Bits256>>` etc.

## Returning vectors

This is currently not supported. If you try returning a type that is or contains a vector you will get a compile time error.
