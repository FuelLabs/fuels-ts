# Calling external contracts

Your contract method might be calling other contracts. To do so, you must feed the external contract IDs that your contract depends on to the method you're calling.


```typescript
    const contract = await setupContract();
    const otherContract = await setupContract({
      cache: false,
    });

    const scope = contract.functions.call_external_foo(1336, otherContract.id);

    const { value: results } = await scope.call();

    expect(results.toHex()).toEqual(toHex(1338));
```
