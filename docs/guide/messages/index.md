# Messages

A message is an object that contains some data that when broadcasted to the network, can change the state of the blockchain. This can include sending tokens, creating a new account, or deploying a smart contract. Messages are signed by a sender and broadcasted to the network. This message is then verified and included in a block.

This is the general structure of a `Message` object:


```typescript
/**
 * A Fuel message
 */
export type Message = {
  sender: AbstractAddress;
  recipient: AbstractAddress;
  nonce: BN;
  amount: BN;
  data: BytesLike;
  status: MessageStatus;
  daHeight: BN;
};
```
