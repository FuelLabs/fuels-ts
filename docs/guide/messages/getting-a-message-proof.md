# Getting a Message Proof

A message proof is a cryptographic proof that a message was included in a block. You can use the `getMessageProof` method to retrieve a message proof for a given transaction ID and message ID.


```typescript
    const result = await tx.wait();
    const messageOutReceipt = <TransactionResultMessageOutReceipt>result.receipts[0];
    const messageProof = await provider.getMessageProof(
      TRANSACTION_ID,
      messageOutReceipt.messageID
    );
```
