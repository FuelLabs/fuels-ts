# Getting All Resources

You can use the `getResourcesToSpend` method to retrieve a list of all the resources (coins + assets) that can be spent by a given address.


```typescript
    const walletLocked = Wallet.fromAddress(
      '0x09c0b2d1a486c439a87bcba6b46a7a1a23f3897cc83a94521a96da5c23bc58db'
    );
    const resourcesToSpend = await walletLocked.getResourcesToSpend([
      {
        amount: bn(2),
        assetId: '0x0101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101',
      },
    ]);
    expect(resourcesToSpend[0].amount.gt(2)).toBeTruthy();
```
