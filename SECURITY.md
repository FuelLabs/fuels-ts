# Security Policy

The Fuel Typescript SDK is still in development, which means that our implementation may have issues.

We take security vulnerabilities very seriously. If you discover a security issue, please immediately bring it to our attention!

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability or exploit, please [**report privately**](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-ts/security/advisories/new).

Please **DO NOT file a public issue**.

We will send a response indicating the next steps to handle your report. The security team will let you know about the progress toward a fix and full announcement and may ask for additional information or guidance.

If the issue is an implementation weakness that cannot be immediately exploited or something that has not yet been deployed, just discuss it openly.

## Reporting a non security bug

For non-security bugs, please simply file a GitHub [issue](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-ts/issues/new).
