# Security Policy

The Fuel Typescript SDK is still in it's development phase. This means that there may be issues in our implementation.

We take security vulnerabilities very seriously. If you discover a security issue,
please bring it to our attention right away!

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability or exploit, please [**report privately**](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-ts/security/advisories/new).

Please **DO NOT file a public issue**.

We will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

If the issue is an implementation weakness that cannot be immediately exploited or something that has not yet been deployed, just discuss it openly.

If you need assistance, please reach out to [security@fuel.sh](mailto:security@fuel.sh).

## Reporting a non security bug

For non-security bugs, please simply file a GitHub [issue](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-ts/issues/new).
